# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION
This project predicts  survival using a Random Forest Classifier. Data preprocessing was done using label encoding and missing value imputation. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed key survival patterns. The model was evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. It showcases end-to-end machine learning on real-worldÂ data
